### Using Keras & Theano for deep learning driven jazz generation
I built [*deepjazz*](http://deepjazz.io) in 36 hours for HackPrinceton, Spring 2016. It uses Keras & Theano, two deep learning libraries, to generate jazz music. Specifically, it builds a two-layer [LSTM](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html), learning from the given MIDI file. It uses deep learning, the AI tech that powers [Google's AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/alpha-go.html) and [IBM's Watson](https://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/what-is-watson.html), **to make music -- something that's considered as deeply human**.
